 # Project Overview
Pig E. Bank is a well-known global bank looking for anti-money laundering and customer retention support. The Pig E. Bank stakeholders are most interested in assessments of client risk and transaction risk, as well as reporting on metrics.

# Key Objective
Analyze historical customer data to optimize the utilization of predictive models in reviewing customer churn and retention

# Key Questions 
- What factors have lead to customer churn?
- What factors have lead to customer retention?
- Who is most at risk?

# Methodology
- Data Collection and Preparation: In Excel, I cleaned and wrangled the raw customer data. Exported minimal customer information, and eventually removed all PII based on data ethics, privacy, and protection laws.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: I utilized data mining techniques to extract insights from big data.

- Predictive Analysis: Using a predictive model, specifically a random forest to create an at-risk customer decision tree.

# Limitations
Data is from an unknown date. There isnâ€™t a lot of data to show ongoing churn and retention trends. Provided with some demographics based on country, gender, and age, including tenure, account balance, products, credit card, activity, estimated salary, and current bank status

# Conclusion and Recommendation
 - Activity Status
 encourage customer activity by expanding number of products, Inactive customers are more at risk of leaving the bank

 - Products & Services
 products and services provided customer with one product stand higher risk leaving bank 

 - Research/Customer Feedback
 Better understand customer banking needs through regular surveys and interviews
